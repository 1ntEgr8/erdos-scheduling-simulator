# Implementation of the TPC-H workload graph for the Simulator.
# This file implements the structure for the TPC-H query DAGs.
# The profiles for the corresponding DAGs can be retrieved based on the
# size of the dataset and the cluster where the DAGs were executed.
# (See e.g., profiles/workload/tpch/cloudlab)
# The nodes of the TPC-H DAG is defined based on the Spark stage number that
# was observed during execution.
